# Trans-SVNet: Accurate Phase Recognition from Surgical Videos via Hybrid Embedding Aggregation Transformer

You can refer to https://github.com/YuemingJin/TMRNet for data pre-processing.

1. run train_embedding.py to train ResNet50
2. run generate_LFB.py to generate spatial embeddings
3. run tecno.py to train TCN
4. run trans_SV.py to train Transformer

Note: although TCN is trained using the whole video, no future information is used for each mini-batch. Please refer to the TeCNO paper for details.

We used additional Matlab code to produce the finally reported results based on the saved predicted phases of each time step. The evaluation code is in https://github.com/YuemingJin/TMRNet.
